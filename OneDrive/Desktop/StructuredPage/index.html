    <h2><u>Java</u></h2><p>
    Java is a programming language and computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. It has evolved from humble 
        
        beginnings to power a large share of today’s digital world, by providing treliable platform upon which
many services and applications are built. New, innovative products and digital   
services designed for the future continue to rely on Java, as well.

While most modern Java applications combine the Java runtime 
and application together, there are still many applications and even some websites that will not function unless you have a desktop Java installed.

Java.com, this website, is intended for consumers who
 may still require Java for their desktop applications – 

specifically applications targeting Java 8. Developers as well 
as users that would like to learn Java programming should visit the dev.java website instead and business users should visit oracle.com/java for more information.

JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages,
        
        
many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language,

supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles. Read more about JavaScript.

<b>Operating system:></b> <p>Your computer's operating system (OS) manages all of the software and hardware on the computer. Most of the time, there are several different computer programs running at the same time, and they all need to access your computer's central processing unit (CPU), memory, and storage. The operating system coordinates all of this to make sure each program gets what it needs.
 Types of operating systems
  </main> 
  Operating systems usually come pre-loaded on any computer you buy. Most people use the operating system that comes with their computer, but it's possible to upgrade or even change operating systems. The three most common operating systems for personal computers are Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux.</p>
